                                <p>
                                    The Gumm Family began the first established local delivery service in Dallas/Ft.
                                    Worth. In 1951, while working as a
                                    local cab driver, William E. Gumm was dispatched to pick up flowers from a florist
                                    and deliver them to Baylor
                                    Hospital.
                                    He immediately saw an opportunity to capitalize on an untapped market ... fast,
                                    reliable, and courteous delivery
                                    service
                                    to the Dallas area. Mr. Gumm's business originated out of his garage in Oak Cliff,
                                    and eventually moved to a
                                    downtown
                                    office in 1954.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By the late 1980's, his personable grandson, Barry J. Gumm took the knowledge that
                                    his grandfather had taught him
                                    and
                                    began what is now known as the fastest courier service in Dallas, On Time Couriers.
